# GraphColoring-Project
Developed GCP algorithms in Java to compute the exact chromatic number, the upper bounds and the lower bounds of given sets of seen and unseen graphs; Creation of a single-player game with GUI using JavaFX, which implements the GCP algorithms and has 3 games modes

üèÜ Won First place for the fastest and most accurate algorithms out of 32 groups
