# GraphColoring-Project
A semester-long group project split into 3 phases. Please consult _2020-2021_1-1_ProjectManual.pdf_ for more information about the project and its phases. 

Our code for each phase is in a separate folder and inside there's a README file that explains how to run the code.

**Short summary**: We developed GCP algorithms in Java to compute the exact chromatic number, the upper bounds and the lower bounds of given sets of seen and unseen graphs. We created a single-player game with GUI using JavaFX, which implements the GCP algorithms and has 3 games modes.
For further explanation of what we did, please consult _FinalReport.pdf_.

üèÜ We won First place for the fastest and most accurate algorithms out of 32 groups!
