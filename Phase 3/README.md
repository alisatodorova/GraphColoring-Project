# Project 1.1 : Graph Coloring
The final phase of the project includes multiple algorithms to best solve the Graph Coloring Problem.
Please note that there are two file reader classes included, one for the example graphs and one for the DIMACS graphs.
The reader for the example graphs is automatically used, the other is commented out above it.
Only uncomment one of these two reader initializers!
The tester file runs the code in the same way as the tournament code.
Note that the Welsh-Powell algorithm is included but not actually used.
This is due to its weak results, however, we still wanted to show the work done.

# Installation
Download and extract the zip file. Keep all java files in one folder.
The main file is the 'tester.java' file, this should be compiled and run.

```bash
javac Tester.java
```
Finally, run the java file with an example graph as argument
```bash
java Tester 2020-2021_exampleGraphs/graphXX_2020.txt 
```
where XX is the number of the graph.
